# otp

One time pad- python
Takes a plaintext file, and generates a random key and then encrypts the file using the key, while creating a ciphertext file and a key file. 
Also has the option to decrypt, given that the ciphertext file and key file already exist. 
While otp is the most secure crypto system, I advise against using this code for actual encryption because the keygen() function is only psuedo random. I do not take responsibility for your carelessness if you ignore this warning.
